"# Fosser"

How to start: Open index.html with google chrome or firefox. I haven't tested it with any other browser.

CONTROLS:

MOVE: <- ^ v -> (Arrows)
DIG: WASD
CONFIRM: SPACEBAR

How to play:

The objective is to dig holes to make the zombies fall into them, 
once a zombie falls into a hole, it'll be stunned for some seconds, and then it'll come out on its own.
So to kill them for good you have to dig again on top of the hole with the zombie inside and it'll die.

You can get killed by your holes too, be careful! You can remove an empty hole digging it again. 

There's a hard mode when you reach 3000 points. 

If the game looks too small you can zoom in with the normal google zoom.

The code is probably really bad and this was a school project, so expect a lot of bugs.
Also: There's no win screen, you can "win" filling the whole map with tombs, but the game doesnt end,
I'll add it at some point.

I dont own any of the music or images used in this game.
